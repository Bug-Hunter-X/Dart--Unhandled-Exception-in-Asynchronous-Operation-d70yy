# Dart Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Operation

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient error handling in asynchronous operations, specifically network requests.  The `bug.dart` file shows code with inadequate error handling, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior.  The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

## Problem

The original code attempts to fetch data from a remote API.  However, it doesn't handle potential exceptions (like network errors or invalid JSON) gracefully.  If an error occurs, the application might crash or behave unexpectedly.

## Solution

The solution involves comprehensive error handling within the `try-catch` block.  Specifically:

1. **Check the HTTP status code:** The code now checks `response.statusCode`.  If it's not 200 (OK), an exception is thrown, providing context for the error.
2. **Handle JSON decoding errors:** The `json.decode` function can throw exceptions if the response body is not valid JSON.  This should be handled in a `try-catch` block within the `if (response.statusCode == 200)` block. 
3. **Log exceptions:** Exceptions are logged to the console, aiding debugging. The choice to rethrow or not is made based on whether application stability is preferred over receiving all errors.
4. **Informative error messages:** Error messages are more descriptive, making it easier to understand what went wrong.

This improved error handling makes the application more robust and less prone to unexpected crashes.
